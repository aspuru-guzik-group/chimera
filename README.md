# Chimera: hierarchy based multi-objective optimization

``Chimera`` is a general purpose achievement scalarizing function for multi-objective optimization. It allows 
the user to set a hierarchy of objectives along with relative or absolute thresholds for them to be optimized
concurrently. For more details, please refer to the following publication:

F. Häse, L.M. Roch, and A. Aspuru-Guzik. "[Chimera: enabling hierarchy based multi-objective optimization 
for self-driving laboratories](https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c8sc02239a#!divAbstract)". 
*Chemical Science* **2018**, 9(39), 7642-7655.

###  Installation
``Chimera`` can be installed with ``pip``:

```
pip install chimera
```

The installation requires only ``python >= 3`` and ``numpy``.
